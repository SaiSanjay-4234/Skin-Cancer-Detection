# Skin Cancer Detection and Classification

This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to detect and classify skin cancer from digital images as benign or malignant. The primary goal is to provide an early detection system using deep learning.

## Features
- Preprocessing of image data, including resizing and segmentation.
- Feature extraction using techniques like GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix).
- CNN-based classification of skin lesions.
- Visualizations of processed images, classification accuracy, and confusion matrices.
- Visualization of results using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: Main script for running the project
- `dataset/`: Folder containing benign and malignant image samples
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for the project
